To normalize the data from the three tables containing information on Brazilian flora it is necessary first to clarify how this data would be used. The idea is to create a 
dataset containing relevant information for the genus Begonia. I chose this genus because there is a high probability that it will be partly investigated in my Ph.D project.
My goal is to perform phylogenetic and biogeograpchic studies with a clade of 16 species that occur in areas of "campos rupestres" and forests in the Atlantic Forest.

To make the dataset more functional my idea is to maintain the 'taxon' table, reducing the number of columns to those that will be relevant for my objective. However, instead
of having 'distribution' and 'species profile' as two separate tables the idea is to combine them, once the information can be easily related between both. Also, once the tables
are ready and combined I will slect only the information pertaining the species of Begonia I am interested in.

For the 'taxon' table the columns maintained are numbered from 1 to 8. They received new names and have a data type assigned. Also, the primary and foreing keys are defined below:

NUMBER  COLUMN NAME               NUMBER OF NEW COLUMN  NAME OF NEW COLUMN  DATA TYPE
1	taxonID                   1                     ID                  Integer (Primary key)
5	scientificName            2                     TAXON               String
6	acceptedNameUsage         3                     ACCEPTED_NAME       String
8	namePublishedIn           4                     NAME_INFO           String
21	taxonomicStatus           5                     TAX_STATUS          String
22	nomenclaturalStatus	  6                     NOM_STATUS          String
24	bibliographicCitation     7                     BIBLIOGRAPHY        String
25	references                8                     ONLINE_REF          String

For the 'distribution' and 'species profile' tables all the columns were maintained, but received new names. Data type is assigned for each one of them, as well as primary keys
and a foreign key for 'species profile', once it will be later joined to the 'distribution table'. 

NUMBER  COLUM NAME               NUMBER OF NEW COLUMN  NAME OF NEW COLUMN  DATA TYPE
1       id                       1                     TAXON_ID            Integer (Primary key)       
2	locationID               2                     STATE               String
3	establishmentMeans	 3                     SITUATION           String
